Linear regression predicts a real-valued output based on an input value. 
This program uses linear regression for housing price prediction, based on 13 input features including:


CRIM - per capita crime rate by town

ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.

NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)

RM - average number of rooms per dwelling

AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940

DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres

RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways

TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000

PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town


and one target value: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
This is done with the use of the cost function and gradient descent. 

Additionally, a Normal Equation is used to predict median value.

Topics explored:
Linear Regression
Cost functions
Univariate Gradient Descent
Multivariate Gradient Descent
Normal Equations

New concepts of Python (to me) that I learned through this project:
Plotting using matplotlib
Matrix multiplication (@)
Matrix transpose
Matrix reshape
List to numpy array through numpy.concatenate
Matrix vector multiplication
